## My First Experience Using Javascript

This class isn't my first experience using Javascript, but instead in high school where I took an AP Computer Science class. The class was primarily Java but there were times when other languages were explored, one of which was Javascript. However, Javascript not being the main focus of the course, it was very brief section and mainly consisting of basics, involving nothing that was specific to Javascript. Because of this, I didn't have the idea that it differs quite significantly from Java, and not just because of the type of applications they are used to create.

## Javascript So Far

After completing the ES6 modules and the Javascript basics, it’s obvious that Javascript diverges from the pack of languages I’ve learned, including the ones I’m the most accustomed to -- Java and C. Parts of the language such as function nesting and  destructuring are among some properties that seem weird or hard to read to me. There are other unusual things that the language lets you do, such as what is shown below.

The first statement shows that an array plus an array returns an empty string. The next two show an array plus an object returns an object, but the operands in reverse order returns something different, a 0. The result of an addition should be the same, or at least similar, if you reverse the operands. And lastly, an object plus an object returns not a number (NaN). 

In most of the languages I have used before, attempting to do anything like this causes some sort of type error or requires methods to be used. The fact that Javascript lets you do this is weird to me. Especially since some of the outputs don't quite make sense. For instance, I think it makes more sense to return a merged array when adding two arrays, instead of combining their contents into a single string and returning that. 

In spite of these weird quirks, I think Javascript could end up being a useful and flexible language to work with. I would like to learn it well since I could apply that experience to maintain a website I am in charge of for work.  

I have yet to write much Javascript that is unique to the language, so it is hard to say if I like or dislike the language overall. Most of what we have done, including the Workout of the Day (WOD) exercises have just been basic exercises that could have been done similarly in most other languages.

## Workout of the Day

In concept, I think WODs are quite useful. They help with getting one's brain adapted to quickly thinking up and implementing a solution. However, I think that the WODs we have had so far are on the easier side, thus attempting to get a solution within the allotted time is not very difficult.
