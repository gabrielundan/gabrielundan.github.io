| *My current feelings regarding UI design* |


## Why Learn UI Design?
Being able to design and implement a user interface (UI) is a skill I think every programmer who wants to be a software engineer should have at least some experience with. Although it may not be one's programming focus, it's still an important component of a finished product that one should be aware about. After all, if the users can't navigate a product's UI easily or efficiently, they will instead opt for one that checks those boxes whilst retaining the same feature set, leading to wasted time for both the developer and the user. 

## My First bout with a CSS Framework and UI Design
I was excited upon first hearing that we were to learn a CSS framework, thus streamlining the creation of a website's UI. Prior to using Semantic UI, my CSS experience was limited to doing extremely basic tasks such as changing colors, fonts, or centering an individual item. Thus, Semantic UI is my first step into UI design. I hoped that I could learn how to use Semantic and incorporate what I learned into a work project in need of a facelift. 

However, I haven't had the smoothest experience with learning how to use Semantic. When trying to replicate the layout of a pre-existing website, I find myself unsure of what the best ways to imitate certain looks are. I ponder things such as: "Should I place an image in a `<div>` and have it fill the whole space or should I set the `background-image` of the `<div>` instead? Does it matter?" Although I can attribute this to my lack of UI design experience, the learning curve does seem steeper than I originally had thought. I'll probably have to learn what the goto Semantic classes are depending on the need of the webpage before I start feeling comfortable and not constantly refer back to old work or examples. 

Though it cannot be helped, I dislike that the majority of tags end up being a `<div>`. For me, this makes it harder to understand what is happening at a glance since all the code seems to blend together incoherently, especially without proper formatting. 

Comparing this experience against debugging (non-CSS) code, I would rather do the debugging. No matter how tedious the task may be, there is a clear and straightforward way to reach the end goal: stepping through the code and verifying it does what was intended until a deviation is detected. Then it's just applying a fix from there. When working with Semantic, it can feel like a guessing game when checking the documentation and attempting to find the combination of CSS classes that best satisfies my use case. 

Though this was an unpleasant experience, I have heard that other CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap are more beginner-friendly and have a much larger community following, leading to an abundance of available tutorials and more robust documentation. Perhaps learning an easier CSS framework on the side will help me get familiar with creating webpages and make the transition to Semantic much quicker and more comfortable.
