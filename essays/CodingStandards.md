When it comes to learning anything, such as a spoken language, a craft, or a mentality, there exists some form of standard or even etiquette as to how it should be performed and practiced. Abiding by them typically allow for some sort of gain, such as the minimization of difficulty or higher quality output. 

Take baking for example. Not every confectionary uses the same recipe, but their creation involves some standards such as mixing all your wet and dry ingredients separately before combining them, resulting in a more consistent mixture which can then bake properly. Practicing this can make one a better baker, especially when practicing other basics of baking. To be considered good at something, one should be well versed in the basics and fundamentals, which standards usually focus on. 

When it comes to programming, it is no different. Although abiding by coding standards and following a certain format and syntax can be tedious, it gets programmers used to a style of coding that is generally easy to read for others. If the code ever needs to be revisited in the future, the reader is more easily be able to identify any problems compared to if no standard were used.
