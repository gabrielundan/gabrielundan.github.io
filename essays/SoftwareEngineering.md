## What I Have to Gain

I believe that there are several skills I can learn and benefit from while taking this software engineering course. The skills I'm the most interested in developing include learning JavaScript and any frameworks, learning the fundamentals of user experience, and how to efficiently coordinate with a team to develop a project. 

### Learning JavaScript 

JavaScript is a language that many incorporate into their websites on both the frontend and backend. I don't have much experience working on websites, so having to create professional looking websites in this class is valuable experience as someone who is interested in software development as a career path. My only prior experience with websites is maintaining a website for work, which was originally created by someone else. The website isn't very sophisticated, nor is the pre-existing user interface anything to write home about. Thus, I wouldn't deem it much of an exemplar to follow. 

JavaScript also commands a more flexible style that is vastly different than the C, C++, and Java that I've grown accustomed to. Because of this, it's likely that I'll learn different and perhaps more efficient ways to program. 

I already know a few languages and I would definitely like to add JavaScript to that growing list. I wish I had learned to be proficient in it sooner, as I had met someone who was running a local company which was in need of people to add to their development team. They were looking for someone who knew more web-based languages and frameworks, such as JavaScript, React, Angular, and PHP -- all of which I had little to no experience with. Had I been exposed prior, I may have been accepted into a position. 

### Learning UX

A sizeable factor of what users think about a product come from the presentation, so I believe it is important to do it well.  Since I am to rebuild the website I currently maintain for work, I'm hoping that I would gain some insights on what defines a good user interface aside from the maxim "A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it's not that good." I understand that an interface which is challenging to use can debase an otherwise impressive program. So, learning to create pleasant and accessible interfaces may cause users to appreciate the product more than they would have. 

### Learning Team Skills in Software Development

I do have experience programming in a teams, but I am more comfortable coding alone. When I coded in a team setting, very little planning was done prior to programming resulting in many errors and time wasted on resolving Git merge conflicts. I can only picture a group setting working if all members of a team are given the same Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram, or if something akin to Java's abstract classes and interfaces are used to help eliminate as much code conflicts as possible.

Since software development is usually done in teams, this would be a helpful experience if I could understand the ideal team workflow and dynamic for any future group development projects.
