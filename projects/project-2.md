## What is FRC

FIRST Robotics Competitions involve some game that teams must build their robot around. In 2016, the game was FIRST Stronghold where the game was centered around a team's robot being able to easily traverse the field obstacles and shoot accurately into the opposing alliance's goal. Robots that were able to do this the best would be able to score balls into the goal quicker and therefore generate points quicker.

## My Role

I was in the programming subteam, so I was to make sure to robot operated in accordance with its intended design and functionality. If part of the robot was designed to intake and shoot a ball, I was to allow that movement and map that action to a controller button or stick to allow the driver of the robot easy control. Since I was the lead, I was also in charge of managing the rest of the team, and teaching them how to program in Java for the robot, C for any Arduino sensors that would be used, and git for version contorl. This was a hard task for me, since I didn't really know how to teach someone or help another person code, much less be able to delegate tasks efficiently. Nonetheless I still tried and I believe that attempting to teach someone how to code did help my personal understanding of it. 

## What I Learned

Prior to this experience, my only programming experience was programming in an AP Computer Science highschool class. When there were programming assignments, it was never more than a few Java classes working together to complete the assignment. Programming a robot for a competition such as this one can require more than of 15 Java classes just to get the base functionality of getting the motors moving, the controls working, and the solenoids firing. Because of this, I learned more about how inheritance, abstraction and encapsulation work in Java, and why they are used. 

I also tried to learn how to program in a group environment using git because prior to this I only had experience programming solo. It is difficult to do since how functions are called, function names, and variable names need to be decided and agreed upon to avoid conflicts when it comes time to merge. 

## Source Code

The source code is from a private repository so I am unable to freely share the code I worked on.
