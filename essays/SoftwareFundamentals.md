Similar to any other field of study, software development also has its fundamentals which can be applied outside of just developing an application. For example there are concepts behind project management, and design patterns that remain relevant in the entirety of software development.  

## Planning Ahead
Regardless of the scale or intended goal, planning ahead is always a good idea as it sets yourself up for success. When designing an application, agile project management was used to identify the next steps to be done, ensuring that team members know what to work on. Every week more planning is done based on completed tasks, unfinished tasks, and any newly desired features, resulting in a refreshed task list. This process is repeated for the duration of the application development cycle.  

I can see myself using this in the future for other projects since the methodology lets you pace your workflow and adapt it based on both new and pre-existing factors. Planning via project management is something I would want do in every future project. As much as possible I would want to identify and fix any design holes or any missing pieces of a proof of concept.
