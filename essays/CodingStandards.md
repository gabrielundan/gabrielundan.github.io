When it comes to learning anything, such as a spoken language, a craft, or a mentality, there exists some form of standard or even etiquette as to how it should be performed and practiced. Abiding by them typically allow for some sort of gain, such as the minimization of difficulty or higher quality output. 

Take baking for example. Not every confectionary uses the same recipe, but their creation involves some standards such as mixing all your wet and dry ingredients separately before combining them, resulting in a more consistent mixture which can then bake properly. Practicing this can make one a better baker, especially when practicing other basics of baking. To be considered good at something, one should be well versed in the basics and fundamentals, which standards usually focus on. 

Programming is no exception. Following coding standards and adhering to a certain format and syntax can be tedious, it gets programmers used to a style of coding that is generally easy for others to read. If the code ever needs to be revisited in the future, the reader is more easily be able to identify any problems compared to if no standard were used. Drawing from my work experience I am maintaining a website I did not create, I can say that my job would be much easier had the original developer had written comments or followed some kind of standard when working on this project. It would have saved the time it took to understand the code before implementing changes that wouldn't inadvertently break anything. Adhering to standards and programming in a manner which is easy to understand is a skill, one that readers will appreciate. This skill will especially be helpful in the industry where teamwork is necessary and looking at or working off of someone else's code is required. 

Following standards can also help establish a structure to copy, which is particularly useful for beginners, who may not have much experience programming. Having a predetermined structure to replicate can help beginners get comfortable and acquainted with the language, speeding up their learning process. Although it can be argued that knowing standards may not help with learning how to approach a coding challenge, it can help one to be on their way to the solution.
