## Project Overview
Books for Bows is a group developed web application that was developed to make the process of finding affordable easier for University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) students. To do this, the app focuses on facilitating the buying and selling of textbooks in between students. Its features include users being able to see and search through what textbooks others have put up for sale, as well as list their own books. Users also get additional information such as book previews to make sure the user is creating a listing with the correct book. UHM courses that employ the use of the viewed textbook is also shown.  

For more details on my groups app, please refer to [the Books for Bows github.io page](https://books-for-bows.github.io/).

## My Role
Within the Books for Bows team, my contributions were focused on developing the functionality of the app. For example, a few of the things I worked on include creating a functional search bar and creating React Components that correctly display data from a Mongo Database, as well as manipulate that data. The main pages I worked on were the marketplace page which lists displays all unique listings (on a per book basis) as a card, and the shelf page, which lists all the available listings for the selected book. I preferred doing back-end work and other work similar to this rather than creating and implementing design elements.

## What I Learned
Prior to this experience I haven't developed an web-application from the ground up before -- I had only implemented changed to a pre-existing one, so this is a new experience for me. The closest experience I have to this is probably my participation in FIRST Robotics where I also had to develop code in a group environment using Git. Although this similarity is shared between the two, there wasn't nearly as much merge conflicts as I expected there would be. In Robotics, I remember fixing at least one or two conflicts most of the time I decided to merge. Over the course of developing this app, I think I may have had to fix a grand total of about five conflicts, which is quite low for my expectations.
