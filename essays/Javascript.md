## My First Experience Using Javascript

This class isn't my first experience using Javascript, but instead in high school where I took an AP Computer Science class. The class was primarily Java but there were times when other languages were explored, one of which was Javascript. However, Javascript not being the main focus of the course, it was very brief section and mainly consisting of basics, involving nothing that was specific to Javascript. Because of this, I didn't have the idea that it differs quite significantly from Java, and not just because of the type of applications they are used to create.

## Javascript So Far

After completing the ES6 modules and the Javascript basics, it’s obvious that Javascript diverges from the pack of languages I’ve learned, including the ones I’m the most accustomed to - Java and C. Parts of the language such as function nesting and  destructuring are among some properties that seem weird or hard to read to me. There are other unusual things that the language lets you, such as what is shown below.

An array plus an array is an empty string. An array plus an object is just an object. The result of an addition should be the same if you reverse the operands, but that results in 0. And lastly, an object plus an object is not a number. 

However, as time passes and I see their uses I could end up enjoying these features that are unique to Javascript. 

I have yet to write much Javascript that is unique to the language, so it is hard to say if I like or dislike the language overall. Most of what we have done, including the Workout of the Day (WOD) exercises have just been basic exercises that could have been done similarly in most other languages.

## Workout of the Day


## In the context of programming

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
