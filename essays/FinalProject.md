## Final Project Idea

Making the right kind of connection can make or break a project. Whether within one's major or across the campus, establishing and maintaining a connection with a like minded student can be the key in gaining the right insight, elevating an invention, and exploring the full potential of one's idea. Yet, you don't know if someone can provide the right perspective just by looking at them, which is why we propose an application that immediately puts you in contact with other, like-minded, students, purely based off of your projects, experience, and aspirations.
