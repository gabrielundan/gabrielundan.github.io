## What is FRC
FIRST Robotics Competitions involve some game that teams must build their robot around. In 2016, the game was FIRST Stronghold where the game was centered around a team's robot being able to easily traverse the field obstacles and shoot accurately into the opposing alliance's goal. 

## My Role

I was in the programming subteam, so I was to make sure to robot operated in accordance with its intended design and functionality. 

## What I Learned

Prior to this experience, my only programming experience was programming in an AP Computer Science highschool class. When there were programming assignments, it was never more than a few Java classes working together to complete the assignment. Programming a robot for a competition such as this one can require upwards of 15 Java classes just to get the base functionality of getting the motors moving, the controls working, and the solenoids firing. 

## Source Code
The source code is from a private repository so I am unable to freely share the code I worked on.
