## My Role

I was a tutor at Leeward Community College's (LCC) Learning and Resource Center (LRC) for almost 2 years (Jan 2017 - Dec 2018). When I was first asked to be an ICS tutor, I took it up because I didn't want to be stagnant with my programming skills. At the time, I was unable to take any additional ICS courses involving programming until I am able to attend UH Manoa. So, instead of going semesters without programming and having my knowledge deteriorate, I decided to put it to use and help other students who needed help coding. 

## What I Learned

Through this experience, I feel that I have improved in becoming more articulate and helping people approach a problem. However, I still would not consider myself to be particularly good at either, they were necessary skills needed to be efficient at what I did. In order for get someone to understand a topic to a greater degree, I find it best to offer them an alternate description or perspective, or break it down in a way they may have not yet considered.
